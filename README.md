# Managed Adaptation of EDFlib

This is a managed .dll build of edflib that can be used on a windows platform. E.g., my goal is to use it from Unity.

# EDFlib

EDFlib is a programming library for C/C++ for reading and writing EDF+ and BDF+ files.
It also reads "old style" EDF and BDF files.
EDF means European Data Format. BDF is the 24-bits version of EDF.


## Usage

Build with VS 2017 (or probably any other reasonable alternative on win) with a .dll target.

Include the dll in your managed application (e.g. Unity) and have fun.
